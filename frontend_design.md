# Front-End Design for Trello_GPT

This document outlines the steps to design a front-end for the Trello_GPT system. A well-designed user interface can greatly enhance the user experience by allowing users to visualize and interact with the system and its outputs.

## Define the User Interface Components

Identify what elements the user needs to interact with. These could include:

- A display area for the AI-generated content (subtasks and card descriptions)
- Buttons or controls to accept, reject or edit the AI-generated content before adding it to Trello
- Notifications or alerts for the status of the process (fetching tasks, processing tasks, updating tasks)
- A log area to track the history of actions and changes

## Design the Layout

Once you have identified the components, decide on a layout for your interface. You could use a web design tool or sketch out your design. The layout should be intuitive and user-friendly.

## Choose a Front-End Framework

Depending on your preferences and the complexity of your interface, you might want to use a front-end framework like React, Vue.js, or Angular. These frameworks provide powerful tools for building interactive user interfaces.

## Implement the Design

Once you have a design and a framework, you can start building the front-end. You'll need to connect your front-end to your existing Python backend, likely through a REST API or similar interface.

## Test

Conduct thorough testing to ensure that the front-end works well with the backend and provides a good user experience.

## Iterate

Based on user feedback, continue to refine and improve the design. This iterative process is crucial to ensure that the front-end meets the needs of the users and provides a seamless user experience.

This is a high-level overview of the process. The specifics will depend on your exact requirements, your skills and experience, and the tools you have available.   


# Step 1: Define the User Interface Components

Before we can design a UI, we need to understand what functionality it needs to provide. Here's a list of components that we might need for this application:

- **Task Display**: This is a list or table that displays the tasks from Trello that are to be processed. Each task could be a row in the table with columns for task name, task description, and status (processed or not processed).

- **AI Generated Content Preview**: When a task is selected, this area will show the AI generated content such as the task description and subtasks. This should be editable by the user before it is sent back to Trello.

- **Accept/Reject Buttons**: These will be used to accept or reject the AI generated content for each task. Accepting the content will update the task in Trello, while rejecting it will discard the AI generated content.

- **Notifications/Alerts Area**: This will display any important information or status updates about the system's operations. For example, it could display a message when tasks are being fetched from Trello or when an update to a Trello card is successful.

- **Activity Log**: This area will display a history of actions taken by the user and the system. For example, it could show when tasks were fetched, when AI content was generated, and when tasks were updated on Trello.

This is a basic set of components that should cover the system's main functionality. Depending on the specific needs of your users, you might want to add more components or functionality.

# Step 2: Design the Layout

The layout of the application determines how the components are organized on the screen. The goal is to create an intuitive and user-friendly layout that allows users to easily navigate and use the application. Here is a basic layout that corresponds to the components we defined:

- **Task Display**: This could be positioned on the left side of the screen. Users can select a task from this list to view and edit the AI generated content.

- **AI Generated Content Preview**: This could be in the middle of the screen, to the right of the Task Display. This is where the AI's generated content for the selected task will be displayed.

- **Accept/Reject Buttons**: These could be located below the AI Generated Content Preview. After reviewing and editing the AI-generated content, users can click these buttons to accept or reject the content.

- **Notifications/Alerts Area**: This could be at the top of the screen, spanning the width of the screen. This would make it highly visible, ensuring that users do not miss any important notifications.

- **Activity Log**: This could be located on the right side of the screen. This allows users to view the history of actions at a glance, without interfering with their current task.

Remember, this is just a basic layout suggestion. The final design should take into account the preferences and needs of your users, as well as the aesthetics of the application.

The next step after this would be to create a mockup or prototype of the layout. You can use a tool like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD to create a visual representation of th
