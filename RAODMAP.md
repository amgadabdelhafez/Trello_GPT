# Trello_GPT Project Roadmap

This roadmap provides a comprehensive overview of the future features and objectives for the Trello_GPT project. The project aims to enhance an AI's ability to assist users in managing personal tasks and to-dos.

## 1. Near-Term Objectives

The immediate focus of the project is to improve the AI's understanding of the user's workflow and to assist in task management.

### 1.1 Task Status Updates

The AI should be updated about task and subtask completions. This will allow the AI to keep track of the user's progress and suggest new tasks accordingly.

### 1.2 Task Prioritization

The AI should assist in prioritizing tasks based on various factors such as urgency, importance, or due dates. This will help the user to focus on the most critical tasks first.

### 1.3 Reminder Notifications

The system should be enhanced to send the user reminder notifications about upcoming tasks or subtasks. These notifications could be integrated into Trello or sent through the user's preferred communication channel.

## 2. Mid-Term Objectives

The mid-term objectives focus on improving the AI's ability to manage tasks over time and provide useful summaries.

### 2.1 Rescheduling Assistance

The AI should suggest rescheduling of tasks and subtasks based on the user's progress and upcoming tasks. This feature will help optimize time management.

### 2.2 Daily/Weekly Task Summaries

The AI should generate daily or weekly task summaries. These summaries would provide an overview of completed tasks, upcoming tasks, and task management suggestions.

## 3. Long-Term Objectives

The long-term objectives aim to make the AI more proactive and context-aware.

### 3.1 Contextual Task Generation

The AI should suggest new tasks based on the user's past tasks and subtasks. This feature will help the user consider tasks that they might not have thought of.

> Note: The implementation order and timing of these features will depend on user feedback and development capacity. Contributions from the community are welcome and appreciated!

## 4. Front-End Development

Creating a front-end for this system will enhance user interaction and experience. Here are the detailed steps for designing and implementing a front-end for this system:

### 4.1 Define the User Interface Components

Identify the elements that the user needs to interact with. These could include a display area for the AI-generated content, buttons or controls to accept, reject or edit the AI-generated content, notifications or alerts for the status of the process, and a log area to track the history of actions and changes.

### 4.2 Design the Layout

Decide on a layout for your interface. The layout should be intuitive and user-friendly. Use a web design tool or sketch out your design.

### 4.3 Choose a Front-End Framework

Choose a front-end framework like React, Vue.js, or Angular based on your preferences and the complexity of your interface. These frameworks provide powerful tools for building interactive user interfaces.

### 4.4 Implement the Design

Start building the front-end based on your design. Connect your front-end to your existing Python backend, likely through a REST API or similar interface.

### 4.5 Test

Conduct thorough testing to ensure that the front-end works well with the backend and provides a good user experience.

### 4.6 Iterate

Based on user feedback, continue to refine and improve the design.
